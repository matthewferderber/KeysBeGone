#KeysBeGone
KeysBeGone (KBG) is a command line tool to remove secret keys from your project so you can share code without worrying about your secretz being stolen!

To start working on the project type the following the command line while in the project directory:
***npm link***

Working Commands:
- **kbg add <key> <value>**
- **kbg rm <key>**
- **kbg help**

Lots of stuff that still needs to be worked on:
- Replacing the keys
- Automated tests
- Encryption
- Refactoring code
